Optimally concentrated Gabor transform for localized time-frequency components

This contains the set of matlab codes for creating gabor windows that optimally concentrate a given signal in the time-frequency (TF) plane. The window is adapted to a chosen part of the signal (TF component). This window gives a sparser representation of the component.

This code is an implementation of the methods described in the following papers:

To run the code, the Matlab toolbox LTFAT is required.
